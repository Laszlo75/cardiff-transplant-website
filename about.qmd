**Cardiff and Vale University Local Health Board** was established on 1st October 2009 and is one of the largest in the UK, providing health services for over 500,000 people living in Cardiff and the Vale of Glamorgan. We also serve a wider population of 2.5 million people across South and Mid Wales for specialties such as paediatric intensive care, specialist childrenâ€™s services, renal services, cardiac services, neurology, bone marrow transplantation and medical genetics.

The **Cardiff Transplant Unit** at the University Hospital of Wales is a leader in the field performing approximately 120 adult kidney transplants per year, which includes compatible and incompatible living donor (aprroximately 40 per year), deceased donor (approximately 60-70 per year), and Pancreas transplants (approximately 10 per year).
 
The unit has a standalone multi-organ retrieval team and is part of National Organ Retrieval Services (NORS) providing retrieval services nationally and also runs a Normothermic Regional Perfusion programme for DCD donors.

In addition to transplant services, the unit provides a full dialysis access service for South East Wales, performing approximately 450 cases per year, including all forms of arterio-venous grafts, HeRO grafts, and endovascular fistulas.
